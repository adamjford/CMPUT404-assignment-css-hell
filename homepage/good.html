        <p>
            Hi! I'm a web developer, with a smattering of games on the side.
            Most of my experience lies on Microsoft's .NET stack (especially ASP.NET MVC), but
            I've also hacked on Ruby on Rails and Django projects. Hire me if you want a motivated,
            experienced developer with a focus on maintainability and understandability of code, 
            and passion for learning.
